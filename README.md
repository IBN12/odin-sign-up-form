# **odin-sign-up-form**
The Odin Project - Project Sign-up Form

This project will involve a sign-up form for an imaginary service. The main page will contain an image
and a form section with various inputs. The inputs will be of type text, email, tel, and password.
The image next to the form will have a logo section on top of it. The sign-up form will contain 
a submit button for creating the user account. The user can also click on a **log-in** link underneath 
the submit button if the user already has an account. 

## **input types**
text
: There will be two text types for the users first name and last name.

email
: The email type will take a user email input.

tel
: The tel type takes a user phone number input.

password
: There will be two password types. The first one will be the initial password input, and the second will be the password confirmation input.

## **background-image**
The background image next to the main form will be artwork created by [Yoshitaka Amano](http://google.com/search?q=Yoshitaka Amano).
The source of the artwork is [character-design-references](characterdesignreferences.com/artists-of-the-week/yoshitaka-amano).

## **JavaScript for password types**
The javascript program is designed to determine if both user inputs of type password match. Passwords that match are **valid**, and passwords that don't match are **invalid**.  Matching passwords will initiate a section that displays a message in the color green. Passwords that don't match will initiate a section that displays
a message in the color red.
